# DATABASES: TEST-DRIVING A REPOSITORY CLASS CHALLENGE

----

## Introduction

>In the realm of PostgreSQL, we manipulate tables, column names and records. However, in Ruby programs, we represent data using classes, objects and attributes. We therefore need a way to transform the data retrieved from the database into data that can be used in our program.
>
>To achieve this, you will learn how to build two kind of classes â€” they're regular Ruby classes, but designed to achieve a specific purpose in our program:
>
> * A **Model class** is used to hold a record's data.
>For example, if we have a table students, we'd have a class Student, with attributes for each column. A single object holds the data for a specific student record. This class usually doesn't contain >any logic, but is only used to hold data.
>
> * A **Repository class** implements methods to run SQL queries on the database to retrieve, create, update or delete data.
>For example, if we have one table students, we'd have a class StudentRepository containing methods that communicates with the database using SQL.

## Objective

To learn how to test-drive "Model" and "Repository" classes to `SELECT` records from the database.

For this challenge, I will be creating a Book Store project that will use a "Model" and "Repository" classes.

## Designing a repository class for selecting records from the database

| Method |      Job       | Arguments |   SQL query it executes  |     Returns    |
| ------ | -------------- | --------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
|  all   | gets all books |   none    | `SELECT ... FROM books;` | Array of book  |

## How to run it and print out the list of books in the terminal:

```bash
# in the book-store directory:
$ ruby app.rb
```
